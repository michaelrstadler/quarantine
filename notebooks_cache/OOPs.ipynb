It solves the problem that we want to work on instances of the class (e.g., shea, or barney, or luna), but in our class code we don't yet know the name of the instance. *__self__* is a stand-in for the name of the instance, so you can mentally replace *__self__* with __shea__ when thinking about how this code will operate when you make *__shea__*. *__self__* is always the first argument to the __\\_\\_init\\_\\___ method, and we use *__self__* + dot notation to do things specifically to the *intance* that gets created out of our class. \n",

Remember from looking at our old friend the humble __list__, Python objects don't just store data but can also do stuff like—for lists—append and sort.

But we also want to keep the option of calling the shorter general dog information. Child methods override parent methods...how can we get the parent method back after we've overriden it?

    "__super()__ creates a temporary instance of the parent object, giving you access to all of its functionality (including overriden parts!) from inside the child class. Pretty cool! __super()__ is also useful within class method generally as a means to call methods from the parent when you haven't instantiated an object yet. \n",

    "A fair question to ask is why we can't just explicitly create a temporary __GoodBoy__ object to get access to parent methods. The answer is that we can! That'll work. The advantages of __super()__ are that its a bit more elegant (whatever that means) and that when you get into more complicated patterns of inheritance, it can be advantageous not to explicitly name the parent but rather to generaically call \"whatever the parent is\". That's pretty advanced stuff though, so for now let's just say using __super()__ to call parent functions from within a child object is nifty and Pythonic and will make you look like you know what you're doing! For the curious, here's a [lesson](https://realpython.com/python-super/) from RealPython that goes into some depth about super.\n",

    "So why do we need classes? Do we need classes? The answer is probably no: object-oriented programming is just a style. Put another way: OOP isn't for computers—it's for humans. The computer is ultimately getting the same instructions whether you write it in an object-oriented or procedural (or any other) style. OOP exists for the people who write and read code as a useful way to organize and understand programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the advantages of classes? When you read intros to OOP, you they always emphasize that it makes programming match the way you look at the world already. We have a concept of what a “car” is, and within that car we know what a 1995 Toyota Celica is, and we know that Stad’s busted-ass-because-he’s-a-forever-postdoc 1995 Toyota Celica is a specific instance of that kind of car. So object-oriented approaches match programming abstraction to human abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s probably true, but honestly I always roll my eyes a little. I mean, high level languages are already pretty abstracted and human-readable, and it's not that hard to think in lists and dataframes. For my (admittedly limited) usage I have found the main advantage of classes to be that it’s simply a convenient way to group code and data when programming. I constantly end up with related things in my code. For example, for a single confocal movie, I have a bunch of data: the image stack itself, information about the experiment (date, fly line, microscope, labeled gene, developmental stage…), information extracted from the movie (nuclear mask, MS2 spot mask, intensity profiles of spots). I also have a bunch of functions that I wrote to work on these data (nuclei segmenter, MS2 spot segmenter, normalization functions…). There are lots of ways I could organize this code, but a very convenient way to do so is to create a __Movie__ class and populate movie objects with all the things I need.\n",

    "I'm sure I've massively under-used and ill-understand the full power of classes. Hopefully this is a decent introduction, and you all will go off, start using classes, and learn lots of wonderful new powerful things about them. Happy coding!"
